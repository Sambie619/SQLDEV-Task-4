# 📊 Day 4 - SQL Aggregate Functions & Grouping

This task focuses on summarizing data using **aggregate functions** and grouping results using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses. The queries are based on the `library` database schema created earlier.

---

##  Task Objectives

- Apply aggregate functions: `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`
- Use `GROUP BY` to categorize data
- Filter grouped results using `HAVING`

---

##  Tables Used

- `Books`
- `Genres`
- `Members`
- `Borrow`

---

##  Queries Included

### 1. 📈 Aggregate Functions on Numeric Columns

- Total number of books in the library
- Average number of borrows per member
- Total number of borrowed books

### 2. 📂 Grouping Data with `GROUP BY`

- Number of books per genre
- Number of books borrowed per member

### 3. 🔎 Filtering Groups with `HAVING`
